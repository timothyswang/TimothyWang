**Biography:**
I am currently a first year Ph.D. student with Professor R. Michael Young at the University of Utah. I'm studying the intersection of computer science (especially AI) and storytelling in order to develop a more complex and nuanced computational model of narratives. My current research is looking at how to improve planning models as an approach to a computational model of narratives, incorporating more complex narrative concepts such as character arcs and story structure.
